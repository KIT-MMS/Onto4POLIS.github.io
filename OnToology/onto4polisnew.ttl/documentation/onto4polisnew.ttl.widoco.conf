abstract=This study focuses on building an ontology for a multi-scale simulation process in the electrochemical battery domain. The Onto4Polis(S) was constructed following a seven-step procedure in web ontology language (OWL) and an open-source ontology editor called protégé. The bottom-up modeling approach was chosen to model all the identified applications for ontology. The included concepts (classes) and their hierarchy, relationships, and axioms in the ontology were finalized with the assistance of domain experts. Some concepts were borrowed from other ontologies as needed. Ensuring the use of already defined semantically equivalent concepts, rather than creating new ones, was a priority. Utilizing the Linked Data concept, the developed ontology's concepts are interlinked with other structured data (ontologies) on the web via unique identifiers, resulting in enhanced semantic capability. E.g., EMMO ontology, BattINFO, PROV-O are some examples of interlinked ontologies. The developed ontology conveniently represents structured and organized information, formally describing the multi-scale simulation process in the electrochemical battery domain through explicit ontological concepts and their possible relationships. This work is essential for guiding researchers through the entire research data management process from the ground up. Our findings also offer new insights into the previously unexplored domain of electrochemical batteries. However, ontology development is an ongoing process; nevertheless, the constructed ontologies can be effectively utilized for their intended purpose. Refinements are made at regular intervals as new information becomes available. The ontology is published on GitHub Pages and accessible via the following link. https://kit-mms.github.io/Onto4POLIS.github.io/

description=Onto4POLIS(S): An Ontology for modeling the multi-scale simulation process of electrochemical batteries. The Onto4Polis(S) ontology has been developed to model the multi-scale simulation process of electrochemical batteries. The simulation process encompasses all scales, i.e., atomic, nano, and micro. The Onto4Polis(S) was constructed following a seven-step procedure in web ontology language (OWL) and an open-source ontology editor called protégé. The included concepts (classes) and their hierarchy, relationships, and axioms in the ontology were finalized with the assistance of domain experts. Some concepts were borrowed from other ontologies as needed. Ensuring the use of already defined semantically equivalent concepts, rather than creating new ones, was a priority. Utilizing the Linked Data concept, the developed ontology's concepts are interlinked with other structured data (ontologies) on the web via unique identifiers, resulting in enhanced semantic capability, e.g., EMMO ontology, BattINFO, and PROV-O are some examples of interlinked ontologies.
