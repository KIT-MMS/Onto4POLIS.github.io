<span class="markdown">Onto4POLIS(S): An Ontology for modeling the multi-scale simulation process of electrochemical batteries. The Onto4Polis(S) ontology has been developed to model the multi-scale simulation process of electrochemical batteries. The simulation process encompasses all scales, i.e., atomic, nano, and micro. The Onto4Polis(S) was constructed following a seven-step procedure in web ontology language (OWL) and an open-source ontology editor called protégé. The included concepts (classes) and their hierarchy, relationships, and axioms in the ontology were finalized with the assistance of domain experts. Some concepts were borrowed from other ontologies as needed. Ensuring the use of already defined semantically equivalent concepts, rather than creating new ones, was a priority. Utilizing the Linked Data concept, the developed ontology's concepts are interlinked with other structured data (ontologies) on the web via unique identifiers, resulting in enhanced semantic capability, e.g., EMMO ontology, BattINFO, and PROV-O are some examples of interlinked ontologies.
